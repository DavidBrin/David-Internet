# # Unsupservised Learning
#
# ## Labelling Data is Expensive
#
# In supervised machine learning, one aims at learning a mapping $f_{\psi} : \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}^P \rightarrow \mathbf{y}$ from observations $\mathbf{x}$ to the target $\mathbf{y}$ using a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i\}_{i=1, \dots, N}$ of finite size N (e.g. image classification, translation). Because of the curse of dimensionality, high-dimensional inputs (images) and complex the models (deep learning) require large datasets (million of pairs $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$). In practice, labelling data is expensive (e.g. marking the presence of cancer in X-ray chest scans).
#
# ## Compression is Comprehension: Learning without Target
#
# In order to overcome the curse of dimensionality, we aim at learning a compressed representation $\mathbf{z} \in \mathcal{R}^M$ of $\mathbf{x}$ such that $M < P$ and there is a mapping $g_{\phi}: \mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{z}$ linking each data point to its representation. Ideally, $\mathbf{z}$ is low-dimensional set of features which efficiently describes $\mathbf{x}$. As an illustration, when modelling pictures of celebrities (CelebA dataset), the set of facial features (eye color, age, hair lenth, etc.) is a compressed (and lossy) representation of $\mathbf{x}$. In practice, the representation  $\mathbf{z}$ is unobservable and [unlikely to overlap with such known features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12359). Yet, the representation $\mathbf{z}$ is low dimensional and learning a mapping $f_{\psi} : \mathbf{z} \in \mathcal{R}^M \rightarrow \mathbf{y}$ is often easier.
#
# Whereas labelling the data is expensive, observations $\mathbf{x}$ are cheap to acquire. In many cases, one can scrap the web to gather a large collection of images or text. As a result, large deep learning models can be deployed to learn $g_{\phi}$, and smaller / data-efficient models can be applied downstream to solve the supervised task.

# # Auto-encoders: Compression as a Generation Process
# In this notebook you will implement a simple auto-encoder (AE). We assume that you are already familiar with the basics of neural networks. We will start by defining an AE similar to the one used for the finetuning step by [Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/science.pdf). We will experiment with the AE setup and try to run it on the MNIST dataset. There has been a wide variety of research into the field of auto-encoders and the technique that you are about to learn is very simple compared to modern methods: Masked Autoencoders ([MADE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03509), [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) and Variational Autoencoders ([VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), [VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937), [BIVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02102), [NVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03898)).
#
# In unsupervised learning, we aim at learning compressed representations $\mathbf{z} \in \mathcal{P}$ of $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}$ where $ M < P$. The architecture of an autoencoder can be decomposed in two steps:
#
# 1. *Encoding* $\mathbf{x}$ into a low-dimensional representation $\mathbf{z}$ using a neural network $g_{\phi} : \mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{z}$.
# 2. *Decoding* the representation $\mathbf{z}$ into a reconstruction $\hat{\mathbf{x}} = h_\theta(\mathbf{z}) \in \mathcal{R}^P$.
#
# Because $M < P$, the encoding acts as an information bottleneck: only part of the information describing $\mathbf{x}$ can be encoded into $\mathbf{z}$ as long as $M$ is sufficiently small.
#
# Learning the parameters of the autoencoder relies on two aspects:
#
# 1. A distance in the observation space $d : \mathcal{R}^{P} \times \mathcal{R}^{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$ (e.g. MSE), measuring the reconstruction quality.
# 2. Using backpropagation coupled with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the parameters $\{\phi, \theta\}$ w.r.t $L := \frac{1}{N} \sum_i d(x_i, h_{\theta}(g_{\phi}(\mathbf{x})))$.

# *The exercises are found at the bottom of the notebook*

# ## MNIST
# First let us load the MNIST dataset and plot a few examples. In this notebook we will use the *dataloaders* and *datasets* provided by PyTorch. Defining the loading of datasets using a dataloader has the advantage that it only load the data that is *neccessary* into memory, which enables us to use very large scale datasets.
#
# We only load a limited amount of classes defined by the `classes` variable to speed up training.

# ### Building the model
# When defining the model the latent layer $z$ must act as a bottleneck of information. We initialize the AE with 1 hidden layer in the encoder and decoder using ReLU units as nonlinearities. The latent layer has a dimensionality of 2 in order to make it easy to visualise. Since $x$ are pixel intensities that are normalized between 0 and 1, we use the sigmoid nonlinearity to model the reconstruction.

# # Exercises

# ## Exercise 1: Analyzing the AE
# 1. The above implementation of an AE is very simple.
#     - Experiment with the number of layers and try different non-linearities in order to improve the reconstructions
#     - What happens with the network when we change the non-linearities in the latent layer (e.g. sigmoid)?
#     - Try to increase the number of digit classes in the training set and analyze the results
#     - Test different optimization algorithms such as ADAM and RMSProp and decide whether you should use regularizers
#
# 2. Currently we optimize w.r.t. mean squared error.
#     - Find another error function that could fit this problem better
#     - Evaluate whether the similarity function $d$ is a better choice and explain your findings
#
# 3. Complexity of the bottleneck.
#     - Increase the number of units in the latent layer and train
#     - Visualize by using [PCA](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) or [t-SNE](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html)

# ## Exercises 2: Adding classification for semi-supervised learning
#
# The above training has been performed unsupervised. Now let us assume that we only have a fraction of labeled data points from each class. As we know, semi-supervised learning can be utilized by combining unsupervised and supervised learning. Now you must analyze whether a trained AE from the above exercise can aid a classifier.
#
# 1. Build a simple classifier (like the ones from week1) where you:
#     - Train on the labeled dataset and evaluate the results
# 2. Build a second classifier and train on the latent output $\mathbf{z}$ of the AE.
# 3. Build a third classifier and train on the reconstructions of the AE.
# 4. Evaluate the classifiers against each other and implement a model that improves the classification by combining the input, latent output, and reconstruction.
#
# Below we provide some starting code for using only a subset of the labelled data.
